## Community Server Utility Bot

##Overview

This is the Tech Project Mix community server bot. It is an amalgamation of many different purposes, and it is monolithic for simplicity. 
Though, there are plans to peel away certain services.

##Motivation

Bots can serve a myriad of purposes, and many specialize. However, this bot is general-purpose and covers a lot of varied functionality. Our server wanted these
actions to be carried out by a bot in our control that reflects our particular community.

##Usage

The various usages of this bot are accessed in different way, some through commands and others based on events.

- Tags for common questions
- Memes
- Welcome Message on New Member (deprecated)
- Toxicity Detection

##Plans

- Develop a system for pinging those willing to answer code questions.
- Split off Toxicity Detection into a separate microservice.
- Transfer polling system from Ricky's bot here.
